Notes:

Alpine Linux vs Debian: What are the differences?
Alpine Linux and Debian are popular Linux distributions. 
In summary, Alpine is known for its small size, resource efficiency, and focus on security, making it ideal for lightweight environments and containerized deployments. 
Debian offers a more comprehensive package selection, wider community support, and versatility, making it suitable for general-purpose computing and a broad range of applications.
